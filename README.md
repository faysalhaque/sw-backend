Source files for the Tuts+ course: [Hands-On Angular](https://courses.tutsplus.com/courses/hands-on-angular)

The purpose of this course is not to teach you the AngularJS framework, but rather to show you an example of how all these parts work together, including server side, which is developed using Rails. Your instructor, Rem Zolotykh, takes you through such topics as routes, built-in and custom directives, scope, controllers, and services. The first part of this course also illustrates test-first development.
